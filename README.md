# 🌟 Contextual Text Similarity with Sentence-BERT📝

This project demonstrates how to compute contextual text similarity using the **Sentence-BERT** model 🤖. The goal is to calculate the similarity between text pairs and find the most contextually similar sentences to a user-provided input sentence from a dataset 🎯.

## ✨ Features

✅ Uses **Sentence-BERT** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to compute embeddings for sentences.
✅ Calculates **cosine similarity** between embeddings to measure text similarity.
✅ Loads and evaluates text similarity using the **STS Benchmark dataset**📊.
✅ Finds the **top 5 most similar sentences** from the dataset for a given user input🔎.

## 🔍 Example

**📝Input:**
🎵 A person is playing a musical instrument

**🎯Output:**
🎼 A person is playing a piano. (similarity: 0.7312)
🎸 A man plays a guitar. (similarity: 0.7006)
🎹 Someone is playing a piano. (similarity: 0.6983)
🎸 A man is playing a guitar. (similarity: 0.6930)
🎸 A man is playing a guitar. (similarity: 0.6930)


## ⚙️Requirements

🔹 Python 3.7+🐍
🔹 Libraries 📦:
